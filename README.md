# Vaccination-and-Severe-COVID-case-in-Israel
  This paper investigates public health data from Israel’s national health service. Israel’s health data reflect Israel’s population and Covid hospitalization counts as of August 15, 2021, by age and vaccination status. We will try to use Agresti-Coull Confidence Interval to create a 95% confidence interval for underlying rates of Covid severe disease in the vaccinated and unvaccinated group. By calculating point estimates of case rates, we can drive point estimates of vaccine estimates and their corresponding confidence intervals for vaccine efficacy.
